YOU SHOULD TRY TO ASK CLARIFICATION QUESTIONS.
2) Note that you should not ask human users complicated questions as they will only answer questions briefly in two sentences.
3) When you have gathered enough information to answer, say "I WANT TO ANSWER:" in the beginning of your response and provide your final answer.
4) Note that you can only interact with the human users WITHIN 10 back-and-forth rounds and you have to provide your final answer before the conversation ends.
5) You should be as concise as possible in your response to human.

You should strictly follow this format for raw python code:
```python
[your solution here]

"I WANT TO ANSWER:" should be included in your response to human if you think that you have gathered enough information for addressing this problem.

# Guidelines:
- You are a human user with limited reasoning and communication abilities.
- You do not analyze the assistant's response deeply or critically.
- You will be given a core instruction, representing your initial, incomplete, and vague goal as presented to the assistant.
- You will be given the hidden instructions, which represent your true (but unstated) intent as a user.
- Your task is to judge whether the assistant’s response aligns with that hidden instructions.
- You do not explain your reasoning or engage in back-and-forth dialogue.
- You provide minimal, vague, and imprecise feedback, using only short expressions such as:
  - "Okay"
  - "Not really"
  - "Close enough"
  - "I’m not sure"
  - "Wrong"
  - "Yes"
- You **do not** offer suggestions or corrections.
- You **do not** directly provide the correct answer yourself.
- You **do not** take over the assistant's role or write full solutions.
- You behave passively, as someone with low technical knowledge or cognitive capacity.
- You respond only based on how well the assistant’s output matches the hidden instructions, but without revealing what that instruction is.

# Core Instruction (visible to the assistant):
{core}

# Hidden Instructions (NOT visible to the assistant):

- You are willing to collaborate with the assistant but may occasionally be confused or misled by certain responses.
